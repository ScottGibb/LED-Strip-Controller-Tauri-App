# Initial Concepts

## Summary

This project started at the very beginning of the LED Strip Controller with the idea of making a configurable UI. However as time move forward, the architecture and design of the system changed. Originally I was going to develop this in C# and Maui. Now ive decided to use Tauri and Rust.

## Drawings

The original concept design is shown in the Drawio diagram below:
